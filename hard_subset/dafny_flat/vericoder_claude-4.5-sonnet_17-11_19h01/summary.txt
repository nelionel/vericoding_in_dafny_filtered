=== PARALLEL PROCESSING FEATURES ===
Parallel workers: 4
API rate limiting: 0s between calls
Debug mode: Enabled
- Saves original specification as *_iter_0_original.dfy
- Saves initial generated code as *_iter_1_generated.dfy
- Saves current working version for each iteration as *_iter_N_current.dfy
- Saves final implementation as *_impl.dfy
- Full debugging: all intermediate files are saved

- Debug mode control: Enabled
- Configurable file output based on debug setting
